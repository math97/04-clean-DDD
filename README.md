### DDD (Domain-driven Design)

Design driven to domain

### Domain
    - Domain Experts
        - Talk with them to understand the product. Domain experts are individuals with deep knowledge of the business domain.
    - Ubiquitous Language
        - A common language used by all team members to ensure clear communication. It bridges the gap between technical and non-technical stakeholders.
    - Aggregates
        - A cluster of domain objects that can be treated as a single unit. Aggregates ensure consistency within the boundary.
    - Value Objects
        - Objects that are defined by their attributes rather than a unique identifier. They are immutable and replaceable.
    - Domain Events
        - Events that signify a change in the state of the domain. They are used to communicate between different parts of the system.
    - Subdomains
        - Smaller divisions within the main domain, each with its own distinct responsibilities and boundaries.
    - Entities
        - Objects that have a distinct identity that runs through time and different states. They are defined by their unique identifier.
    - Use Cases
        - Specific scenarios in which the system interacts with users or other systems to achieve a goal. They help in understanding the requirements and designing the system.
